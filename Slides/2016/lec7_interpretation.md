# 1. Digital Research & Interpretation

--

### Humanities & Interpretation

+ **Stanley Fish** shows how [traditional humanities research deals with statistical frequency and pattern](http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/23/mind-your-ps-and-bs-the-digital-humanities-and-interpretation/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0)
    + direction of inference is critical
    + from interpretive hypothesis to formal pattern
+ Hermeneutic circle
    + understand/interpret through shared human nature
    + circle from object to creator and situation and back again

--

### Digital Humanities & Interpretation

+ **Fish**: In digital humanities it is the other way around
    + run the numbers, then think of interpretive hypothesis
    + the tool dictates the method
    + asserts correlation between formal feature and significance that is declared, not argued for
    + frequency is not an argument (neither are tools)

--

### Digital Interpretation?

+ Does digital analysis exclude interpretive paradigm?

--

### Digital Interpretation?

+ Does digital analysis exclude interpretive paradigm?
+ Does it sacrifice significance, ambiguity, beauty?

--

### Digital Interpretation?

+ Does digital analysis exclude interpretive paradigm?
+ Does it sacrifice significance, ambiguity, beauty?
+ Does digital transform/affect interpretation?

--

### Digital Interpretation?

+ Does digital analysis exclude interpretive paradigm?
+ Does it sacrifice significance, ambiguity, beauty?
+ Does digital transform/affect interpretation?
+ Can digital methods perform interpretation?

--

### Patterns & Interpretation (1/2)

+ **Stanley Fish**:
    + “Don’t we have to actually read the books, before saying what the patterns discovered in them mean?”
    + nothing in the machinery authorises the leap from data to interpretation → you can leap anywhere

--

### Patterns & Interpretation (2/2)

+ **Stephen Ramsay**
    + “What licenses any leap? The text? Of course not. But why must ‘the data’ adhere to a requirement that we long ago disavowed for text?”
    + “Why can’t data function within the same interpretative regime - and fulfil the same hermeneutical functions - as text?”

--

### Object vs. Data

+ **Ramsay**:
    + “Text sometimes operates in the service of objectivity and empiricism, but sometimes not (in the humanities, we might say almost never). Might the same be true of data?”
    + “Is there a humanistic way to generate and understand data that licenses the kind of leaps we want to make?”
+ Is text (object) fundamentally different from data?

--

### Quantity & Interpretation

+ **Fish** attacks stylometry
    + “proponents of stylistics literally don’t know what they’re doing”
+ From statistical perspective (**Liberman**):
    + many interpretations are mere coincidences
    + “a trivial application of statistical methods, humanistic or not, suggests that his idea is probably ‘false’, ‘noise’ and ‘mere play’
+ Should interpretations have statistical support?

--

### Interaction

+ **Ramsay**: “... but if one concedes that reading is a process whereby **patterns urge interpretations** and **interpretations bring forth patterns** (a formulation that implies **no natural sequence or direction**), then we are halfway to saying why you might want to generate a computational program from a critical question or generate an interpretation from a computational procedure.”

--

### Interaction & Hermeneutics

+ **Ramsay**: “Why not do both? In fact, why not do both within tight, concentric loops of reading, hacking, thinking, and interpreting?”
+ Back to the hermeneutic circle?
+ Data-driven research transforms material
    + Interpretation of original objects vs. of data after parsing, filtering, visualising

--

# 2. Big Data & Interpretation

--

### Size Matters?

+ Does interpretation change when we look at very big data sets?
    + difference in degree becomes difference in kind
    + size determines level of analysis (micro vs. macro)

--

### End of Theory

+ **Chris Anderson**:
    + big data often interpreted as having complete data (e.g. Google Books)
    + correlation is all we need, causation is not important
    + e.g. we no longer need theory
    + but [correlation should be connection](http://www.tylervigen.com/)?
    + [Culturomics](http://www.culturomics.org/Resources/A-users-guide-to-culturomics) often [criticised](http://www.newrepublic.com/article/117428/limits-digital-humanities-adam-kirsch) and [ridiculed](http://xkcd.com/1007/)

--

### Big Data

+ When is data big data?
    + comp. scientists say it’s about terabytes or petabytes
    + but what’s the issue with big data?
    + too much to analyse manually
	+ hidding patterns or insights under the surface
    + for many research questions, megabytes of data could be too much.
+ E.g. complex humanities objects, film/text/web site?

--

### Challenging Analysis

+ How similar/different are two:
    + films, songs, books, ...
+ In how many ways can you compare films?

--

### Challenging Analysis

+ How similar/different are two:
    + films, songs, books, ...
+ In how many ways can you compare films?
+ Representing and parsing data require theory
    + e.g. must make assumptions on what meaningful units are there

--

# 3. Collaboration & Interpretation

--

### Collaboration & Humanities

+ Co-authored publications across disciplines
    + Science & Engineering: ~80%
    + Social Sciences: 51%
    + Humanities: &lt; 10%
    + source: Wuchty et al. (2007) “The increasing dominance of teams in the production of knowledge”

--

### Comparing Journals

+ **Lisa Spiro** compared two journals between 2004 and 2008
    + American Literary History (ALH)
    + Literary and Linguistic Computation (LLC)
    + Collaboration in 2% of ALH articles, 48% in LLC articles

--

### Collaboration

+ Why do humanities scholars collaborate less frequently than other scientists?

--

### Collaboration

+ Why do humanities scholars collaborate less frequently than other scientists?
+ According to **Spiro**:
    + quantitative research (truth-finding paradigm) lends itself better to collaboration then interpretive research
    + less recognition for collaboration in humanities
    + Myth of lone genius
    + Humanities work with existing data sources

--

### Quantification & Interpretation

+ **Moretti**: quantitative work is cooperation
    + it doesn’t matter who does the quantifying
    + Unix commands give same outcome regardless of who executes them
+ But: 2 people do same quantitative analysis, get different answers
    + quantifying involves interpretation

--

### Criticising Quantification

+ Two computers running same commands get different answers (or errors)
    + computers are interpreters (actually, it’s the software)
    + implementation details matter!
    + think of *grep -w* 

--

### Core Questions

+ **Spiro** identified four core questions:
    + Why are the digital humanities identified with collaboration?
    + What form does collaboration in DH take?
    + Why collaborate? What advantages does it offer?
    + What are the challenges to collaboration?

--

### Challenges

+ **Spiro**:
    + Giving up control & risking your own perspective being diminished
    + Getting credit for collaborative work
    + Communicating clearly (difficult in cross-disciplinary projects)

--

### Building & Scholarship

+ Is building tools a form of scholarship?
+ Are tool builders different scholars from tool users?

--

### Making vs. Critiquing

+ **[Grusin](http://www.c21uwm.com/2013/01/09/dark-side-of-the-digital-humanities-part-2/)**: focus on ‘making things’ takes away core humanities values, such as critiquing

--

### Making vs. Critiquing

+ **[Grusin](http://www.c21uwm.com/2013/01/09/dark-side-of-the-digital-humanities-part-2/)**: focus on ‘making things’ takes away core humanities values, such as critiquing
+ Is there a difference between *making* and *critiquing*?

--

### Making vs. Critiquing

+ **[Grusin](http://www.c21uwm.com/2013/01/09/dark-side-of-the-digital-humanities-part-2/)**: focus on ‘making things’ takes away core humanities values, such as critiquing
+ Is there a difference between *making* and *critiquing*?
+ Critiquing is a form of making, like devising an algorithm or visualising data
+ There is a multiplicity of builder roles (all use similar metaphors)

--

### Collaborative Interpretation?

+ Does making afford collaboration?
+ Can interpretation be done collaboratively?
    + does collaborative interpretation make sense?
    + (why) would this be difficult?
    + or is it a matter of proper crediting?
    + should individual interpretation be valued more?

--

### Evaluation

+ What are your thoughts on this course? 
    + did it match expectations?
    + what should stay? What should change?
    + balance theory and practical?
    + tempo, quality of tutorials

--

### Next

+ Wednesday 14/10
    + final presentations (15 min)
    + address question, approach, results
    + afterwards, informal evaluation at Zeppos
+ Friday 23/10
    + deadline portfolios
	+ of course, submitting earlier is allowed
